### Technical Skills
I have experience working on a larger scale web application for a construction company. The app was developed using node.js as a base, a framework built by my supervisor, supplemented with pug and jquery. The app also had a MySQL database that was used to hold all of the important company data.

I also have experience programming in Java, Python, and C. I took classes on Java and C here at GVSU and I have done a lot of personal programming in Python as well as some classes from High School which used Python.
